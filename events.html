    <h1><strong><i>Recent Events</i></strong></h1>
    <h2><strong>Cinderella (October 2016)</strong></h2>
    <p>This colourful production was a real success, our youth choir was has been much applauded in the Belfast Telegraph & Irish News.Cinderella played by (Zoey Hamilton) was vocally sensational aswell. Her step sisters played by (Christine Smith & Shannon Hall) were completely self centred and ridicolously funny.</p>

    <h2><strong>The Wizard Of Oz (May 2016)</strong></h2>
    <p>We followed the yellow brick road with Dorothy (Julie Hobson) and it proved to be real show peice. It was a singing foursome with lions, tigers and bears. The cowardly lion (Patrick Britton) was comical and the dopey scarecrow (Josh Allen) was scatty, and the tin man (Niall Kearny) was so sentimental that we were all in tears. The Andersontown News did a special peice on this successful event.</p>
